This recipe creates a fantastically thick and creamy mac & cheese. It is unique in that the pasta cooks in the sauce helping with the thickness of the dish.

===== Yield =====
? A lot

===== Ingredients =====
  * 3 1/2 tbsp (50g) butter
  * 3 tbsp flour
  * 2 cups 2% milk
  * 2 1/2 cups water
  * 2 1/2 (250g) elbow macaroni, uncooked
  * 3/4 cup mozzarella, shredded
  * 1 1/2 cups cheddar, colby, gruyere cheese mix, shredded
  * Salt & pepper (to taste)

===== Cooking =====
  - In medium pot, melt butter over medium heat. Add flour and cook (1 min).
  - Initially mix in 3/4 cup milk, then add the rest to form slurry. Add water.
  - Add macaroni and stir over high heat. Once you begin to see wisps of steam, drop heat to medium-low.
  - Stir regularly until sauce thickens some (9-10 min). Sauce will still be thinner than ideal when it is time to remove from heat!
  - Remove from heat. Stir in cheese quickly and add salt/pepper to taste

===== Serving =====
Serve immediately.
