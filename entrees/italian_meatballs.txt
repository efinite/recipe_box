Author(s): Eric F., Jenny G.

===== Yield =====
20-25 small meatballs

===== Ingredients =====
  * 1 lb Turkey & pork, ground (0.6:0.4 ratio; favor turkey)
  * 1/2 Medium-sized yellow onion, finely chopped
  * 2/3 cup Italian seasoned panko/breadcrumbs
  * 2-5 cloves Fresh garlic, minced
  * 2-3 Tbsp Parmesan cheese, finely grated
  * 2 eggs
  * <1/3 cups Water
  * Fresh herbs (dealer's choice)
    * 2 Tbsp Italian parsley, finely chopped
    * 1.5 Tbsp Oregano, finely chopped
    * 1.5 Tbsp Basil, finely chopped
  * Seasonings (dealer's choice; to taste)
    * Garlic Powder
    * Salt
    * Pepper
    * Red pepper flakes

===== Preparation =====
Mix ingredients well in a bowl. Use wet hands to form mixture into small, 3.5-5 cm diameter balls.

===== Cooking =====
==== Option 1 - Stovetop ====
On medium-high heat, sear the meatballs in a sauce pan with oil until edges brown; goal is somewhat cooked through (3-8 min?). Turn heat to low (simmer). Add a red sauce to the pan and any additionally desired seasonings. Simmer meatballs in sauce for 20-30 min to finish cooking through and incorporate flavors.

==== Option 2 - Oven ====
Preheat oven to 390F. Use shallow pan that will not drip grease. Spray with non-stick or cover with wax paper. Bake until meatballs turn grey (15-20 min?). Switch oven to broil and crisp the tops of the meatballs (1-4 min).

===== Serving =====
  * Stand-alone hors d’oeuvres.
  * With a red sauce over pasta (spaghetti).
  * With a red sauce and soft cheese on garlic french bread (meatball sub style).

===== Note(s) =====
  * Fresh herbs really bring out the flavor.
  * Can refrigerate meatball mixture for 30min before shaping to help meatballs maintain their shape.
  * Cut a finished meatball in half to verify cooked. Pork can contain Trichinella Spiralis! You’ve been warned.
