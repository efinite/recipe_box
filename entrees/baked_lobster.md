-   Large shrimp, cooked, 20+ count
-   Dijon mustard, 1 tsp

## Cooking

-   On a cutting board, split lobsters length-wise. Remove organs and tomalley. Trim smaller legs with scissors. Rinse under faucet. Place in refrigerator on rimmed baking pan covered with aluminum foil until ready to bake.
-   Mix stuffing ingredients together in a large bowl. Salt/pepper to taste.
-   Pre-heat oven to 425F.
-   Stuff lobsters with cubes of butter and slices of lemon.
-   Bake lobsters on top rack for 10-13 minutes. Bake until meat loses translucency and shells lighten/turn light red. Note that claws will cook slower and may need to be given more time. Remove lobster from oven and set oven to broil.
-   Stuff lobsters with stuffing mix. Return to oven on top shelf under broiler. Broil until stuffing begins to brown. Remove from heat.

## Serving

-   Garnish with parsley/lemon slices. Drizzle with melted butter. Serve.

## Note(s)

-   Ingredient measures are guess-ta-ments. Adjust as you see fit.
-   If you would like to use the stuffing for crab cakes, you should consider adding egg whites to better bind the mix.
