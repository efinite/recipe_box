===== Yield =====
1lb pasta

===== Ingredients =====
  * 2 cups flour
  * 1/2 tsp sea salt
  * 3 large eggs

===== Preparation =====
  - Combine flour & salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add eggs. Gently mix eggs and fold in flour until a stiff dough forms.
  - Knead dough (8-10 min). If dough is too dry, sprinkle in water. The dough should grow more pliable and become smooth the longer you work it.
  - Cover with plastic wrap and let rest (45 min).
  - With a rolling pin on a well-floured surface, roll dough as thin as possible. Cut into thin strips, coating with a coarse flour (semolina?) to prevent noodles from sticking together.

===== Cooking | Baking =====
  - In a large pot, bring water to a boil.
  - Cook pasta until al dente (3-4 min).
