14 slices

===== Ingredients =====
  * Crust
    * 20 oreo cookies (regular)
    * 5 Tbsp butter, melted
  * Filling
    * 24 oz  (675g) cream cheese, softened
    * 1 cup (200g) granulated sugar
    * 1 cup (240g) plain full fat yogurt or sour cream
    * 1.5 Tbsp vanilla extract
    * 1-2 tsp almond extract
    * 3 large eggs
    * 18 oreo cookies, crumbled

===== Preparation and Baking =====
  - For the crust: Adjust the oven rack to the lower third position and preheat oven to 325Â°F. 
  - In a food processor or blender, pulse 20 Oreos to fine crumbs.
  - In a medium mixing bowl stir together the Oreo crumbs and melted butter until well combined. 
  - Press mixture into an even layer in bottom of a 9.5 inch glass pie pan. 
  - Bake in preheated oven 9 - 10 minutes then allow to cool as you prepare the filling.

  - For the filling: In a mixing bowl, using a hand-held electric mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and granulated sugar until smooth and creamy.
  - Add in the sour cream or yogurt and the vanilla and mix well. 
  - Add eggs one at a time and mix on low speed just until combined. 
  - Gently fold in 13-15 crumbled Oreo cookies. Do not over-mix. Pour the filling into the cooled crust. 
  - Place the pie pan into a large glass casserole dish pan and place in the oven. 
  - Fill the casserole dish up with hot water until the water level comes about halfway up the outside of the cheesecake pan.
  - Bake in preheated oven 50 - 60 minutes (more like 60-62), or until the center is almost set. 
  - Turn the oven off and open the door slightly. Let the cheesecake rest in the oven for 1 hour. 
  - Remove from oven and allow to cool completely at room temperature. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight.
